PS : Provided with a goal integer target and an array of unique integer candidates, provide a list of 
all possible combinations of candidates in which the selected numbers add up to the target. 
The combinations can be returned in any order.
A candidate may be selected from the pool an infinite number of times. There are two distinct 
combinations if the frequency of at least one of the selected figures differs.
